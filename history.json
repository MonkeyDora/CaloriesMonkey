    "analysis": "The nutritional information for oranges typically refers to the fruit itself, as leaves are not commonly consumed and a single slice is part of the whole fruit. Below is a general breakdown for a **medium-sized orange (131g)**, which includes approximately 62 calories. If a \"slice\" is considered an additional portion, adjust accordingly (e.g., 1/8th of an orange adds ~8 calories).\n\n### **Nutritional Table for a Medium Orange (131g):**\n| **Category**       | **Amount**               | **% Daily Value (DV)*** |\n|---------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|\n| **Calories**        | 62 kcal                  | \u2014                       |\n| **Macronutrients**  |                          |                         |\n| - Carbohydrates     | 15.4 g                   | 5%                      |\n|   - Dietary Fiber   | 3.1 g                    | 11%                     |\n|   - Sugars          | 12.2 g                   | \u2014                       |\n| - Protein           | 1.2 g                    | 2%                      |\n| - Fat               | 0.2 g                    | <1%                     |\n| **Micronutrients**  |                          |                         |\n| - Vitamin C         | 69.7 mg                  | 77%                     |\n| - Potassium         | 237 mg                   | 5%                      |\n| - Calcium           | 52.4 mg                  | 4%                      |\n| - Folate (B9)       | 39.3 \u00b5g                  | 10%                     |\n| - Thiamin (B1)      | 0.1 mg                   | 8%                      |\n\n*Based on a 2,000-calorie diet.  \n*Leaves are not edible and contribute negligible nutrition. A single slice (e.g., 1/8th of an orange) adds minimal calories/nutrients.*\n\n### Notes:\n1. **Leaves**: Oranges are sometimes sold with leaves for freshness, but they are not eaten and provide no significant nutritional value.\n2. **Slice**: A typical slice (1/8th of an orange) adds ~8 kcal, 2g carbs, and trace nutrients.\n3. Values may vary slightly by orange size/variety (e.g., navel vs. Valencia).\n\nLet me know if you need further adjustments! \ud83c\udf4a"
